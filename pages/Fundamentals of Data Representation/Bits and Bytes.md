# Bits and Bytes

A bit is either `0` or `1`. These are then grouped into larger numbers, 8 bits is called a byte.

***Bit*** - 1 or 0.

***Nibble*** - 4 bits.

***Byte*** - 8 bits (2 nibbles).

A kilobyte is 1000 bytes, a kibibyte is 1024 bytes. This continues as the values get larger, e.g. a Gigabyte is 1,000,000,000 bytes but a Gibibyte is 1,073,741,824 bytes.
