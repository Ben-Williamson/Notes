# Representing Images, Sound and Other Data


## Representing Images

***Pixel***- The smallest element that can be drawn on screen.

***Resolution*** - The number of pixels making up an image.

***Colour Depth*** - The number of bits used to represent the colour of a pixel.


### Bitmaps
- Two dimensional arrays using binary values to represent colours.
- Examples include png, gif, jpg. 
- May contain metadata.

### Vector Graphics
- Images are stored as mathematic formula which define parts of the image.
- This makes them more efficient at storing large areas of the same colour.
- Drawings are made up of predefined shapes.
- Fore example: svg.


## Representing Sound
***Analogue data*** - Infinite possible values within a range.

***Digital data*** - Discrete and finite set of values.

When storing analogue data, the value is read at a set frequency and these values are recorded, these values can then be played back at the same rate to reproduce the audio clip.
