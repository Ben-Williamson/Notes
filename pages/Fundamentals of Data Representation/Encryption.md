# Encryption

***plaintext*** - The original message or data.

***ciphertext*** - The encrypted message or data.

***cipher*** - The algorithm used to encrypt the plaintext.

***key*** - The secret to lock or unlock the ciphertext.

## The Vernam Cipher
- The only unbreakable cipher.
- Uses a one-time pad.
- The ciphertext is produced by XORing the value of the key with the data.

### This cipher is unbreakable because:
- Cipher text contains no useful data about the plaintext.
- Frequency analysis can't work because the same character can map to different values.
