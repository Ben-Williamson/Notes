# Number Systems

***Natural Numbers*** - Whole and non-negative. `N=[0, 1, 2, 3, ...]`

***Integer Numbers*** - Whole, can be negative. `Z={..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2}`

***Rational Numbers*** - Can be written as fractions. `Q={1/3, 3/4, 1/6, -0.5, 0, 1, 2, ...}`

***Irrational Numbers*** - Can't be written as a fraction.  `I={√2, √3, Π, ...}`

***Real Numbers*** - Both rational and irrational numbers, possible real-world values. `R = {√2, 1.23, 3.142, -3, -2, -1, 0, 111, 245.56, 3, ... }`

***Ordinal Numbers*** - Describe the position of items in a list, e.g. 1st, 2nd, 3rd, ...


## Number Bases
We use base ten in normal life, this means that each digit has ten possible states.  Other systems exist, for example:
- ***Binary*** - Base two.
- ***Hexadecimal*** - Base 16. (uses letters A-F)

### Advantages of Hexadecimal include:
- It allows large numbers to be written easily.
- RGB colour values fit into six digit hex values.
- It allows compression of long binary bit patterns.

Numbers in hex may be prefixed by 0x.

To convert from Binary to Hex group the bits into nibbles and convert each one.
