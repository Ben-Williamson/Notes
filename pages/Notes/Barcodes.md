# Barcodes

barcodes store numbers and are designed to be read easily. The codes are often used as keys to a database containing infomation about a particular product.

This enables product tracking as each item is given a unique ID.

### There are two types of barcode:
- ***Linear Barcode*** - Vertical strips of various thicknesses.
- ***2D barcodes*** - These can store more data e.g  QR codes.

### Uses:
The first use of barcodes was on train carriages - before barcodes more trains were bought to make up of a lack of effientcy, barcode allowed trains to be tracked and therefore the minimum amount of trains to be used.

### Encoding:
The barcode stores infomation using the differing widths of the black bars, black and white are used as they can easily store binary data and have the most different reflectivity.


#Scaners

### Barcode Scanners:
These work on the idea that white reflects and black does not.  While the light from a scanner looks like a line, however in reality the light is scanning backwards and forwards very quickly. The red laser is used to help the user to line up the scanner with the barcode. These contain a rotating prism to make the laser scan back and forward.

### Pen type readers:
These are similar to scanners but must be manually passed over the code at a constant, steady speed.

### Charged coupled device readers:
These work like a digital camera, they contain sensors which measure ambient light and therefore dont require their own light source.  These don't contain any moving parts and are therefore more reliable than scanners and dont require physical contact like a pen-type reader.

### Camera Based Readers:
These are general purpose cameras with software to read barcodes, this is an advantage as cameras are very common.
