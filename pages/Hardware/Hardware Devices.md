# Hardware Devices

## Digital Cameras

Digital cameras use a grid of tiny light sensors to record the light intensity of points on the plate.  This information is then stored.

***Megapixels*** - One million pixels.

### To improve image quality:
- Decrease the size of light sensors.
- Increase the size of the frame to allow for more sensors to be used.

## Printers
### Laser Printers
A laser beam scan back and forth across a drum inside the printer, building up a pattern of static electricity. The static electricity attracts onto the page a kind of powdered ink called toner, the ink is then cured by two hot rollers.

### Inkjet
Liquid ink is sprayed onto the page in the correct places.

### Advantages of Laser Printers:
- Laser printers are more reliable.
- Can store more ink and can print faster than Inkjet.
- Higher upfront cost, cheaper ink.


### Advantages of Inkjet Printers:
- Can be smaller than Laser Printers.
- Cheaper than laser.

## RFID
Used to identify objects.  RFID devices contain coils and a small chip, a reader induces a current into the coil which gives the chip enough power to transmit its data.  There are two types, Active and Passive.  In active RFID the chip is powered by a power supply giving it a larger range (300 metres).
RFID tags can be written so can be used to store data.

### Uses
- ID, Passports.
- Stock control.
- Parts tracing.
- Allows for automation and allows tasks to be completed without physical contact.

### Advantages
- Small.
- Cheap.
- Does not require power.
- Reliable.
